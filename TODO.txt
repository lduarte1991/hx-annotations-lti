============================
BUGS
-- Deletion of replies doesn't seem to work 
-- Last updated doesn't work
-- Sometimes highlighting doesn't show up the first time you view a target object.
    -- very marginal

-- Can't add multiple texts to an assignment

============================
BROAD TODOS/ISSUES (To be done by fall launch)

-- Do we want a default for an empty dashboard? Or a user with no annotations?

-- Link to dashboard from the detail? So you don't have to go back to the index.

-- Hover to annotate? This was working originally I believe.

-- Test Dashboard et. all to make sure thousands of annotations work.

-- The database token appears to be included in the JavaScript, which can be used to get the entire database
    -- (we tried curl requests with this token from the command line and were able to dump the whole annotations table/db)
    -- maybe more strictly permission-bound tokens could help us here

-- Get rid of "resource_link_id=None" in configuration url...how does that get in there??

-- Update Documentation (may want to wait until we're done with everything else)

-- Duplicate student names break the tool, it seems (Test Student). Make that not happen.
    -- Also, the db max length for the id (name) field is 30. What about long names?
    -- The ID/name field shows up in the admin view when you want to select course admins,
        so it should be human-readable.

-- Need <br/> tags in text entry to format text to be annotated (especially brutal for poems)
    -- see what Luis' changes can do for us

-- Unit Tests :(

-- Currently, we assume that there is only one instructor when it comes to loading in annotations for the instructor tab.
    Eventually we may want to add support for TFs as well.


============================
NOT A PRIORITY/TODO LONG-TERM:

-- Some backend fields don't accept unicode. This may mess up foreign language courses.
    -- May have to restructure DB
    -- I think this is just the primary ID field (the name I believe).
        Everything else I've tried has been chill with Unicode.
        
-- Sometimes going back/forward works smoothly,
    sometimes the document expires. 'Refresh' always takes you back to the index.
    Not a huge deal but something to keep in mind. iFrames are like that I guess.

-- Give instructor 'delete' permission on bad comments?

-- Prettier URL routing

============================
-- Get rid of hard-coded stuff in hx_lti_initializer.views
-- Use auth middleware to allow us to stray from the launch page
-- Improve Instructor index
-- Create Student index
-- Make sure annotations show up at right place on correct assignment
-- Navigation improvements: add in a 'return to index' type of button
-- Clicking on assignment objects shouldn't show the collection ID. Make those just plain text.
-- Add requests library to requirements.txt
-- Change "view assignment" to "view object" or something
-- Figure out what highlight options are/how we can use them, and why they are a required field
-- Make advised changes from Pull Request #3 (Harry and Christian's first one):
    https://github.com/Harvard-ATG/annotationsx/pull/3#discussion_r35117072
        -- ensure people with multiple roles will work
        -- correct url routing
-- Refactor for TLT
	-- all secure/variable settings should be in secure.py
-- 'Dashboard' feature
	-- Mock-up
	-- List of students who have annotated something
	-- List of a specific student's annotations
	-- Remove hard-coded data
	-- Make sure only the annotations for the correct course are coming
	    in, not all the annotations the user has ever made.
-- (fixed) All annotations for a student are shown in the dashboard, as opposed to just the ones for that course.
-- (fixed) Students can only be a member on one course, or else everything breaks.
-- (fixed) Students with the same name cannot be enrolled in a course
    -- Just catch LTIError.userexists and add a '2' to the name (for now)
    
============================
COMPLETED

âˆš Restructure for TLT

============================
DIFFERENCES FROM LUIS
-- Fetches a single course (named active_course) as opposed to fetching all courses for admin
-- Routes student to modified admin_hub as opposed to directly to an assignment
-- Instructor can edit and delete student annotations
-- Home button on assignment pages
